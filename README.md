# GamesWishlist
Personal CRUD project for learning.

This is my mini personal CRUD project that I created to practice the skills I learned while studying Java basics.
The program is console based Video Game Wishlist where you can create and edit multiple wishlists that store (for now only) PS4 and PS5 games.
You can add, modify, remove and view all the games you have in your wishlist so you always know which one to buy next!

The code is pretty self explanatory but I added some comments for parts that I feel need a bit of explaining (at least for beginners such as myself).
